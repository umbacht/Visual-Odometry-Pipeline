## Instructions to run the code:

### Directory setup:
- All .m files in one file named "code" including the file "Exercise Solutions" containing the exercise solution scripts.
- All datasets in file named "datasets" on same level as "code" file
	Relative path for datasets:
		1. "../datasets/kitti/"
		2. "../datasets/malaga-urban-dataset-extract-07/"
		3. "../datasets/parking/"
		4. "../datasets/walking/"

- In main.m: set parameter "ds" (line )

### Running the code

- In main.m file: Set parameter ds to chose which dataset (0: Kitti, 1: Malaga, 2: Parking, 3: Self recorded walking)
