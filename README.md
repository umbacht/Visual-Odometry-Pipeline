## Instructions to run the code:

### Directory setup:
1. All .m files in one file named "code" including the file "Exercise Solutions" containing the exercise solution scripts.
2. All datasets in file named "datasets" on same level as "code" file. 
   Relative paths for datasets:
   - "../datasets/kitti/"
   - "../datasets/malaga-urban-dataset-extract-07/"
   - "../datasets/parking/"
   - "../datasets/walking/"


### Running the code

- In main.m file: Set parameter ds to chose which dataset 
	- ds = 0: KITTI
	- ds = 1: Malaga
	- ds = 2: Parking
	- ds = 3: Self recorded walking
	
- Run main.m


## Videos of datasets:
- [KITTI](https://www.youtube.com/...)
- [Malaga](https://www.youtube.com/...)
- [Parking](https://www.youtube.com/...)
- [Walking (own)](https://www.youtube.com/...)
